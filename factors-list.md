Codebase | one app = one codebase


Dependencies | explicitly declare and isolate


Config | store in the environment


Backing Services | treat as attached resources


Build, release, run | strictly separate


Processes | stateless


Port binding | exported services


Concurrency | scale horizontally


Disposability | fast startup & graceful shutdown


Dev/prod parity | as similar as possible


Logs | stream stdout / stderr


Admin processes | one-off tasks
